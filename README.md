Slide-In-Out-Navigation (Pure CSS/Sass)
=======================

It's simple, fixed to the left side navigation with couple of links.
Beauty of this is a specific way of ejecting navigation by pressing the button without of using JS. Navigation slowly emerges from the left side and pushes content on the website. 
By pressing the button again, navigate back to your starting position.
It works thanks label,input and its sudo  element :checked . If input is ":checked" by LABEL(toggle button) navigation gets transition.
